Hello ðŸ‘‹! Iâ€™m Nikos, also known as nickvourd or NCV. Iâ€™m a Senior Offensive Security Consultant based in the US, with expertise in Microsoft Active Directory, Azure Cloud Security, and Threat-Led Penetration Testing Frameworks like Tiber-EU and iCAST. In my free time, I like to build open-source Offensive Security Tools (OST) in different programming languages. Feel free to connect with me on [Twitter](https://x.com/nickvourd) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickvourd/) if youâ€™d like to discuss anything related to Offensive Security.
